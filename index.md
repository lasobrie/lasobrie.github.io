<p><strong>Léon Sobrie, Ph.D.</strong>, is an incoming postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Tech in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. His research is conducted within the System Performance Lab; a multidisciplinary research lab that studies the interaction between people, technology, and organizations to optimize the performance of complex systems. The lab's goal is to design safe, effective and efficient systems, with a strong focus on the human in the loop. His ongoing research is funded by a National Science Foundation LEAP-HI grant led by Principal Investigator (PI) Professor Konstantinos Triantis, Ph.D.
<!-- , focusing on human-machine interaction in socio-technical systems. -->

<p>Léon's research focuses on designing decision support systems for managing key outcomes in safety-critical control room operations. His work combines multiple methods - predictive analytics, machine learning, causal inference & systems thinking - to develop a deep understanding of socio-technical systems. His research is published in the <em>European Journal of Operational Research</em> and <em>Decision Support Systems</em>.  Additionally, Léon has presented his research at international conferences in the USA, Switzerland, Belgium, Finland, and Greece, and he co-organized an international research workshop titled “Control Room of the Future: AI-Enabled Dashboards”.
