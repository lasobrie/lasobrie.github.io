<p>Léon Sobrie, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Tech in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. His research is conducted within the System Performance Lab; a multidisciplinary research lab that studies the interaction between people, technology, and organizations to optimize the performance of complex systems. The lab's ultimate goal is to design safe, effective and efficient systems, with a strong focus on the human in the loop.

<p>Léon's research focuses on designing decision support systems for managing key outcomes in safety-critical control room operations. His work combines quantitative and qualitative methods to develop a deep understanding of socio-technical systems. His research is part of a LEAP-HI grant led by Principal Investigator (PI) Professor Konstantinos Triantis, Ph.D., focusing on human-machine interaction in socio-technical systems. Additionally, Léon has presented his research at international conferences in the USA, Switzerland, Belgium, Finland, and Greece, and he co-organized an international research workshop titled “Control Room of the Future: AI-Enabled Dashboards”.
